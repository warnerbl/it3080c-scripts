# Premier  Teams

### My project consists of pulling in a soccer api and displaying the teams, points, goal difference and top goalscorer.

##### Steps needed before running
1. pip3 install soccer-data-api
1.5 I already had tkinter installed but if you get errors: install python3-tk 
2. Run the project 
3. Give it time and the window should pop up.
4. If the window does not pop up check your windows down below and you may have to click a window that will have the python symbol in the bottom
