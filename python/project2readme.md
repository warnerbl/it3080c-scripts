Project 2! 

I wrote some code telling us where the International space station is located. The script I wrote pulls the data in JSON format from a API that tracks the International space station.
You will see the name of the satellite. (ISS)
The longitude
latitude
velocity
visibility 
altitude.

Thanks for checking this out.

note: this says lab 8 but i meant to put project 2
